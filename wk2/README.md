# Week 2: The Kitchen Code Mystery 🍳
## Helping Chef Maria Fix Her Digital Kitchen

---

## 🎭 The Story

**Chef Maria just installed a new "Smart Kitchen System" to help run her restaurant, but something went wrong during installation - all the kitchen helper functions have bugs!**

The restaurant opens tomorrow, and she needs your help to debug the system. Each puzzle represents a different part of her kitchen that needs fixing.

*"Welcome to my kitchen!"* says Chef Maria. *"By helping me fix these digital helpers, you'll learn the same debugging skills you'll need for your homework - fixing a broken Rock-Paper-Scissors game!"*

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core Debugging Skills:
- **Console Communication** - Talk to the computer like Chef Maria talks to her assistants
- **Logic Detective Work** - Spot when true/false decisions are backwards
- **Comparison Fixes** - Fix timer problems with wrong operators (`>=` vs `>`)

### The Big Picture:
Each puzzle teaches you to fix a specific type of bug that you'll encounter in your homework:

| Kitchen Problem | Homework Bug | What You'll Fix |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|

## 🔧 How Debugging Works

**Think like a detective:**
1. **Test** - Try the function and see what happens
2. **Compare** - What SHOULD happen vs what DOES happen?
3. **Investigate** - Use console messages to find clues
4. **Fix** - Change one thing at a time
5. **Verify** - Test again to confirm it works

**Remember:** Every bug is a puzzle waiting to be solved! 🕵️‍♀️
