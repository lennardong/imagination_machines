# imagination_machines

`Imagination Machines` is a 4-week, 8-lesson course that will introduce first-time coders to the joy of building things through code. 

We will adopt a do-first-learn-later approach. This is based on the idea that the best way to learn is by doing.

By the end of the course, the students will have built a simple game in JavaScript and HTML. Along the way, we focus on building mental models of how code works through "abstractions". We will do this through extensive diagramming and exploratory trial-and-error. 

## Goal
The goal is gain familiarity with the following concepts:

- Engineering: students will learn the basics of how web applications are built.
- Abstraction: students will learn how to break down an idea into smaller pieces and realize each piece through code.
- UX & Stying: students will learn how to build simple interactive experiences through code. They will learn about the importance of how design and style can affect the user experience.

## Learning Outcomes
By course completion, students will:
- [ ] Build a functional rock-paper-scissors game with 3 difficulty levels
- [ ] Create system diagrams showing data flow and user interactions
- [ ] Debug JavaScript using browser console
- [ ] Style responsive UI with CSS Flexbox

## Technology Stack

- Docker: we will use this as a blackbox. It will be the environment for the students to run their code.
- HTML: we will use a single HTML file for the entire course. This will be used to display the game.
- CSS: we will use a single CSS file for the entire course. This will be used to style the game.
- JavaScript: we will use a single JavaScript file for the entire course. This will be used to program the game.

## Tools

We will use the VSCode IDE for this course. 

## Exclusions

We will not cover any of the following concepts during the course:
- GIT
- deployment
- testing
- CI/CD
- web development best practices

## General Schedule
Classes are on Monday and Tuesday, 8.30 - 10am


## Course Outline

We will learn by doing. 
Every week, templates will be given out and the students will be asked to solve puzzles to understand concepts. 
Finally, we will do some instruction and students are expected to work on their take home assignment. Each week, students are expected to work on their take home assignment for 3~5 hours. 

There are no right or wrong answers. The goal is for students gain confidence in their own ideas and to test it through code. 

The general schedule is as follows:
 
 Monday
- 830 - 9: Presentations & Reflections
- 9 - 10: Topical Puzzles (aka Do First)

 Tuesday
 - 830 - 9: Puzzle Review 
 - 9 - 10: Instruction (aka Learn Later)

### Prep

Please do the following before the first class:
- Setup your system to run Docker on Linux
- Setup your VSCode
- Familiarize yourself with VSCode
- Compelete the assigned readings (~4h)

### Week 1: Infrastructure Setup & Mental Models

Learning Goals:
- Designing with abstractions

By the end we will have:
- Setup our IDEs
- Created diagrams from 3 code samples. This will help us build a mental model of how code works.
- Created a diagram for the game we will be building.


#### Note: Schedule Changes
Monday
- 830 - 9: Introduction
- 9 - 930: Diagram Puzzles (aka Do First)
- 930 - 10: Presentation, Review

Tuesday
- 830 - 930: Infra assistence 
- 930 - 10: Assignment briefing, starting assignment

Takehome Assignment:
- Design a simple game and create a diagram for it. (hint: its rock paper scissors varying challenge levels)

### Week 2: Logical Machines: Variables & Functions
Learning Goals:
- Understanding basic types
- Understanding functions

By the end we will have: 

- Solved simple puzzles with variables and functions
- Experienced using the browser console to interact with our code
- Revised our game diagram to include the language of variables and functions

Takehome Assignment:
- write up the core game logic for rock paper scissors

### Week 3: Experience Machines: HTML, Styling and basic Interactivity
Learning Goals:
- Understanding basic interactivity for the web

By the end , we will have:
- Solved some fun puzzles with HTML, Flexbox and CSS
- Revised our game diagram to include the language of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Drawn a simple UI for our game

Takehome Assignment:
- Write up the UX for rock paper scissors in simple HTML 

### Week 4: TBC

... we will talk about this in Week 3.



### Q&A
- Any questions will be submitted onto the discussion board of this repo.
