# Week 0: Course Prep
**Goal**: Get your tools ready and your mind prepared for puzzle-solving

## Why This Matters
You're about to reverse-engineer mysterious code and debug broken systems. Having a reliable development environment means you can focus on the fun detective work instead of fighting with setup issues.

## Checklist

**Setup (do in order):**
- [ ] Create a dedicated class folder: `imagination_machines` somewhere easy to find (Desktop or Documents)
- [ ] Install VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)
- [ ] Install the "Dev Containers" extension in VSCode
- [ ] **Windows users only**: Install WSL2 and Docker (links below)
- [ ] Download the `.devcontainer` folder and place it in your class folder root
- [ ] Test: Open your class folder in VSCode, click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
- [ ] Verify: Right-click `test-setup.html` → "Open with Live Server" → click the button

**Learning preparation:**
- [ ] Complete VSCode tutorial (30min) - you'll be living in this tool
- [ ] Disable AI assistants in VSCode (we want *your* thinking, not the computer's)
- [ ] Complete assigned readings (~4h) - builds mental models for Week 1

**Windows setup links:**
- WSL2: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
- Docker: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers

## Success Check
By Week 1, you should be able to:
- Open VSCode and create a new file
- Right-click `test-setup.html` and select "Open with Live Server"
- See the test page in your browser and click the button successfully
- Feel comfortable navigating the interface
- Understand why we're starting with puzzles instead of lectures
