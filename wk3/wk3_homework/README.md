## Before You Start

### ‚úÖ Verify Everything Works
1. Open `FixedScissorPaperStone.html` in your browser

- Scoring works correctly (you can win, lose, or tie rounds)
- Game ends after 5 rounds with correct winner announcement
- "New Game" button resets everything to start fresh

### üéØ Your Goal
Transform this functional game into a visual masterpiece using CSS styling techniques from Week 3:
- Apply the skills you learned helping Luna with her school play website

## Connection to Week 3 Learning

### From Luna's Website to Your Game
You learned these concepts helping Luna style her school play website:

**Day 1 Concepts:**
- HTML structure (`<head>` vs `<body>`)
- CSS selectors (element, class, ID)
- Basic properties (color, background, font-size)
- Box model (margin, padding, border)

**Day 2 Concepts:**
- CSS and JavaScript integration
- Dynamic styling with JavaScript
- Interactive elements and visual feedback
- Complete web development workflow

**Apply These to Your Game:**

## Getting Started Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace
1. Open `FixedScissorPaperStone.html` in your browser to see the current game
2. Open `styles.css` in your text editor - this is where you'll do most of your work
3. Notice how the HTML links to the CSS file: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`
4. Have your Week 3 exercise notes ready for reference

**Why separate CSS files are better:**
- ‚úÖ Easier to organize and find your styles
- ‚úÖ Can reuse the same CSS for multiple HTML files
- ‚úÖ Follows professional web development practices
- ‚úÖ Cleaner HTML that focuses on content structure

### Step 2: Plan Your Design
1. Choose your visual theme (colors, mood, style)
2. Sketch or visualize your ideal game appearance
3. Identify which elements need the most visual attention
4. Plan your CSS approach (colors ‚Üí typography ‚Üí spacing ‚Üí polish)

### Step 3: Implement Systematically
1. Work on one challenge at a time in `styles.css`
2. Save your CSS file and refresh your browser to see changes
3. Use browser dev tools to experiment before editing your CSS file
4. Reference your Day 1 and Day 2 exercise materials

**CSS Workflow:**
1. **Edit** `styles.css` in your text editor
2. **Save** the CSS file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
3. **Refresh** your browser (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. **See** your changes immediately!
5. **Repeat** until you're happy with the result

### Step 4: Test and Refine
1. Play multiple complete games to ensure functionality
2. Test your design on different browser window sizes
3. Get feedback from someone else
4. Make final adjustments and polish
